				<p>
					Rock Paper Scissors is an interactive 2-player version of the classic game.  It was developed to
					demonstrate WebSockets in a NodeJS environment.
				</p>
				<p>
					Game play is pretty simple
				</p>
				<p>
					Step 1) Give yourself a name, or let the server pick one for you.
				</p>
				<p>
					Step 2) Challenge any of the player's looking for an opponent.  Simply click on any name and the
					challenge will be made.  If they accept, the game is on.
				</p>
				<p>
					Or challenge your friends.  Click the 'Challenge a friend' button and send the link to anyone you
					know.  You can't do it now, but eventually you'll be able to send the link by email.  For now you'll
					have to copy amd paste it into your email app.  Sorry.
				</p>
				<p>
					You can also challenge the server or wait for another player to challege you.
				</p>
				<p>
					Step 3) Click on any one of the buttons, 'Rock', 'Paper' or 'Scissors'
				</p>
				<p>
					It's that easy.
